## Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch in Java. It is currently designed to process grayscale images (like the MNIST dataset) and classify them into digits (0-9).

---

## Features
- Developed a fully connected nueral network from scratch in Java, supporting multiple hideen layers and customizable architecture.
- Added a drawing pad to test network predictions.
- Implemented a custom Matrix class to handle all linear algebra operations, including dot products, element-wise functions, and matrix transformations.
- Built forward propogation and backpropogation logic to train networks using gradient descent and cost functions.
- Enabled training of networks on labeled data, such as MNIST and Googleâ€™s Quick Draw dataset, with adjustable learning rate, epochs, and batch sizes.
- Added functionality to save and load trained models, allowing quick reuse.
- Designed the system to be modular and extendable for future additions.
